##Crafting recipes: 

(Note: this assumes you are playing on an apple Ipad that I play on. You may be different). 

Press the menu button and pull up the crafting menu. You can then select an item and select one of the 4 boxes in a square, later on 9 boxes in a square. 

1. Wood planks: Place a wood log in one of the boxes to craft 4 wooden planks. 
2. Sticks: Place 2 wood planks so one is above the other to craft 4 sticks. 
3. Crafting table: Place 4 wooden planks in a square to make a crafting table. place it on and then tap it for 9 boxes in a square for better items. We are going to use it a lot!
