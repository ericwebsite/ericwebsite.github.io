## 7/7/2019 Big Fore Ice Caves

I went to the Big 4 Is Ice Cave today.
 
I went all the way there and it was a long trip.
When I got there, I saw Big 4 Ice Cave.
The cave looked big and around.
It looked I could go through it. 
When I walked closer, I felt cold and all water dropped down like raindrops.
Then I climbed the huge rock and mum took photos for me. 
Before go home, I found a special rock like cheese.
I pretended to eat it.
 
I really like that whole trip.

### Rules for the game
Build the game as shown( some pieces are hiding and/or aren't in your
 lego collection). To play, put 5 marbles, one at a time, on the clear 
plastic. Here is the clearer version of the score:

    0 2 4 6 (-1 if toppled)
    1 2 3 4
    1 2 3 4
    0 2 4 6 (-1 if toppled)
When all the marbles are done, record your score on using the chart. 
Here is a clearer version of the score sheet for a player:

    ()+()+()+()+()-()-()=()
    marbles        t- b-
    remark:t- = 1 if upper tower toppled,
    b- = 1 if top lower toppled.


## 7/6/2019 Run in the morning

It is a sunny and warm day. I ran with my dad(Denny) in the morning.:)

I did warmups. I did that first.

I start at my home. I run with a app called RUNKEPPER. I really am walking, 
not running, because I was tired. 
We walk and walk all the way to Powerline Trail. 
I ran on downhills. The first thing I saw is a daisy( I guess).(:

I ran so fast I felt uncomfortable  one downhill with wooden sticks.
I jumped perfectly over the wood. I even saw a dandelion(cool?).

I also saw, stop, and take photo of a pink flower (and trail )(as shown ).

We went into a small passage that led me to home. But on
 our way home, I picked an apple (that I think is raw ). See below for
 a picture.
