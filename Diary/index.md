## 7/14/2019 Turning tumble

Today, I am going to teach you a game called Turning Tumble. It is a marble-powered computer. I like it. 

![](images/IMG_0473.JPG)

1. Each challenge has an object. You must create a machine to do the object. 
2. To start a machine, You must press the start button once. 
3. Once the machine is in motion, you cannot touch the machine or otherwise interfere with it's operator
4. Your machine cannot let balls drop freely for any distance. See the example above. 
5. Challenges start easy, but they become exceedingly difficult, even for a seasoned deep space telecommunications engineer. 

    If you get stuck, take a break and come back to the puzzle later.

### Example:

1. set up it matching, decorations and/or parts may vary.

Ramp: ball goes out a side depending on which way it face*.
Crossover: ball enters one side and out the other. 
Bit: ball goes out one side and then changes the direction it points depending which direction it is pointing before*. 
Interceptor( not shown): stops the marble computer from running. 
Gear bit: gear bits flip each other. If only 2 gear bits are connected together, put high-function washers behind each of them to make them run smoothly.

## 7/8/2019

Today I learned Chinese , "How to introduce Yourself". I am here to show you.
你好
Nǐ hǎo
That means hello. You normally greet with 
Nǐ hǎo
 to normal china people.
 
### Introduce(1)

我姓(last name)
This can be translated as "My last name (is)"
If I introduce, I may say"
你好
(Nǐ hǎo)
我姓王
(Wǒ xìng wàng)"

### Introduce(2)

I can also translate using 我叫(first name, nickname, or full name)
(Wǒ jiào)This is translated as "My name is".
 Tip:
 If your first name have 1(not 2) caracters, you can only use full name or nickname.
My full (Chinese )name is wangruihan
(王瑞涵)I may say 
"Nihaw wojiaowangruihan。"

So zaijian(bye) (user's Chinese name), see you next time.

## 7/7/2019 Big Fore Ice Caves

I went to the Big 4 Is Ice Cave today.
 
I went all the way there and it was a long trip.
